 * DESCRIPTION
 *   Allocate a page frame that is not allocated to any process, and map it
 *   to @vpn. When the system has multiple free pages, this function should
 *   allocate the page frame with the **smallest pfn**.
 *   You may construct the page table of the @current process. When the page
 *   is allocated with RW_WRITE flag, the page may be later accessed for writes.
 *   However, the pages populated with RW_READ only should not be accessed with
 *   RW_WRITE accesses.
 *
 * RETURN
 *   Return allocated page frame number.
 *   Return -1 if all page frames are allocated.

 *   and one process is to free the page.

 *   1. pte is invalid
 *   2. pte is not writable but @rw is for write
 *   This function should identify the situation, and do the copy-on-write if
 *   necessary.

/**
 * switch_process()
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *   If there is a process with @pid in @processes, switch to the process.
 *   The @current process at the moment should be put into the @processes
 *   list, and @current should be replaced to the requested process.
 *   Make sure that the next process is unlinked from the @processes, and
 *   @ptbr is set properly.
 *
 *   If there is no process with @pid in the @processes list, fork a process
 *   from the @current. This implies the forked child process should have
 *   the identical page table entry 'values' to its parent's (i.e., @current)
 *   page table. 
 *   To implement the copy-on-write feature, you should manipulate the writable
 *   bit in PTE and mapcounts for shared pages. You may use pte->private for 
 *   storing some useful information :-)
